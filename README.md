# An Excel Dashboard

<br>

Hello! 

The purpose of this project, was to help showcase my experience with Excel, by building a Dashboard, that aims to better understand the customers, of a small, mock bike business.

## Brief walkthrough

Basically, I first cleaned up the dataset, and used a custom VBA function at a certain point, to categorize the various ages (hence the excel file being macro enabled). 

Then, I started slicing out bits of data that I thought was useful, using Pivot Tables, and after exploring/playing around with the data for a while, I came up with 4 elements for the dashboard. 

A preview of the dashboard is here, for convenience: <br><br><br>
